Generate a Python script that uses Playwright (sync API) to do the following test:

1. Launch the Chromium browser in **headful mode** and **maximize the window** by passing `args=["--start-maximized"]` to `launch()` and setting `no_viewport=True` in `new_context()`.
2. Visit the URL https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us
3. Wait for the page to load.
4. Wait 5 seconds, find the search box(xpath=//*[@id='welcome-page-search-form-autocomplete-input), input 'Azure'
5. Click Enter
5. Wait for the page to load
6. capture the screenshot, name it '002.png'
7. save the screenshot to the screenshots folder.


After writing the script, assign it to a string variable named `script_content`, then call the `save_script_to_tests_folder` tool with:
- `script=script_content`
- `filename="Azure_homepage_searchAzure.py"`

This will save the script in the tests folder.
Save the '002.png' under tests/screenshots folder.
