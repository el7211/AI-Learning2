You are a QA tester, write a Python script using Selenium to:

1. Open the Chrome browser in headful mode using webdriver-manager.
2. Visit the URL https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us
3. Wait for the page to load, maximize the webpage.
4. Scroll down to find 'Artificial Intelligence' and click the link
5. Wait for the page to load.
6. Print the page title.

Use webdriver-manager to manage the ChromeDriver.
Make sure the script handles driver initialization and quitting properly.

After writing the script, assign it to a string variable named `script_content`, then call the `save_script_to_tests_folder` tool with:
- `script=script_content`
- `filename="Selenium_Click_Artifical_IntelligenceLink.py"`

This will save the script in the tests/ folder.
