Generate a Python script that uses Selenium to do the following test:

1. Open the Chrome browser in headful mode using webdriver-manager.
2. Define a list of language codes: ['zh-cn', 'ja-jp', 'fr-fr', 'de-de'].
3. For each language code:
   - Visit the URL https://learn.microsoft.com/{lang}
   - Wait for the page to load
   - Print the page title
   - Use the provided `detect_language` tool to detect the language of the title
   - Print the detected language

Assume `detect_language(text: str)` is already implemented.

Use webdriver-manager to manage the ChromeDriver.
Make sure the script handles driver initialization and quitting properly.

At the top of the script, **include this code block** to enable importing from `tool.py` (located in the `agents/` folder):

````python
import sys
import os

sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
from agents.tool import detect_language
````



After writing the script, assign it to a string variable named `script_content`, then call the `save_script_to_tests_folder` tool with:
- `script=script_content`
- `filename="001_homepage.py"`

This will save the script in the tests/ folder.
