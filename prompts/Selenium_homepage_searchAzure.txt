Write a Python script using Selenium and langid to:

1. Open the Chrome browser in headful mode using webdriver-manager.
2. Visit the URL https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us
3. Wait for the page to load, maximize the webpage.
4. Wait 10 seconds, find the search box(aria-label="Search"), input 'Azure' and click Search
5. Wait for the page to load
6. capture the screenshot, name it '002.png'


Assume `detect_language(text: str, region_hint: str = None)` is already implemented.

Use webdriver-manager to manage the ChromeDriver.
Make sure the script handles driver initialization and quitting properly.

After writing the script, assign it to a string variable named `script_content`, then call the `save_script_to_tests_folder` tool with:
- `script=script_content`
- `filename="002_homepage_searchAzure.py"`

This will save the script in the tests/ folder.
